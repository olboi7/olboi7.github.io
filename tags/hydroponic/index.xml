      <description>Hydroponie project This is a hydroponic system made for a family member. We will compare the effectiveness of the two systems. This system is very simple, it is about an aquarium pump which recyrculates a solution of nutrients. 4 inch and 1/2 inch pvc pipes with the components and glue to join them together were used to build the system. A filter was put on the return to keep the water basin clean.</description>
