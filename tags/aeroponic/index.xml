      <title>The bulding of the prototype</title>

      <description>For the prototype, my goal is to make a light and &amp;ldquo;easy to build&amp;rdquo; module. The reason is simple, one of the strengths of aeroponics is that the system consumes at least 80% -95% less water than hydroponics. Thus an aeroponic system is much lighter. As a result, it can be installed on less strong roofs easier. Roofs will not have to support a large amount of weight of water.</description>

      <title>Aeroponic project</title>

      <description>Why the project? In those days we have to think about the future. If we want to slow down our pollution rate, we have to change our way of thinking an our way of living. In north country like Canada, we depend on south country to feed us. The transport of our food is done by truck over thousands of kilometers. Thus, our food is no longer totally fresh. Furthermore, the pollution produced by these transports is not negligible.</description>

      <description>Low pressure system Aquarium pump was working 24/7 that system made to mush noise &amp;hellip; I removed it 2 days after I had installed it&amp;hellip;
 aa 
No pressure at all Kratky ! I did&amp;rsquo;n wand to waste my crops so I try Kratky method. I put the plant in water and as the plants grow the water level drop, so that the roots can access air.
