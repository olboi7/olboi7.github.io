      <description>Final prototype
September 5, 2021
Finally after more than a year and a half, I finished my industrial prototype. As I mentioned before, the unit should have been 16 feet long in order to be as productive as possible (length of panels normally). I was running out of space, and wanted to save money, so I made a smaller one.

      <description>For the prototype, my goal is to make a light and &amp;ldquo;easy to build&amp;rdquo; module. The reason is simple, one of the strengths of aeroponics is that the system consumes at least 80% -95% less water than hydroponics. Thus an aeroponic system is much lighter. As a result, it can be installed on less strong roofs easier. Roofs will not have to support a large amount of weight of water.</description>

      <description>Low pressure system Aquarium pump was working 24/7 that system made to mush noise &amp;hellip; I removed it 2 days after I had installed it&amp;hellip;
 aa 
No pressure at all Kratky ! I did&amp;rsquo;n wand to waste my crops so I try Kratky method. I put the plant in water and as the plants grow the water level drop, so that the roots can access air.

      <description>Hydroponie project This is a hydroponic system made for a family member. We will compare the effectiveness of the two systems. This system is very simple, it is about an aquarium pump which recyrculates a solution of nutrients. 4 inch and 1/2 inch pvc pipes with the components and glue to join them together were used to build the system. A filter was put on the return to keep the water basin clean.</description>

      <description>Why the project? In those days we have to think about the future. If we want to slow down our pollution rate, we have to change our way of thinking an our way of living. In north country like Canada, we depend on south country to feed us. The transport of our food is done by truck over thousands of kilometers. Thus, our food is no longer totally fresh. Furthermore, the pollution produced by these transports is not negligible.</description>

      <description>Crops evolution I started my seedlings on December 14th 2020. In December th I planted the seedlings in mineral cubes and put them under LED light. One weed later December 29th, I put the cubes in the plant baskets and placed them in my containers.You can see the evolutions on the pictures below.
December 14, 2020 I tried 4 kinds of letuces but the one presented here are the &amp;ldquo;Grosse Blonde Paresseuse&amp;rdquo;.</description>
